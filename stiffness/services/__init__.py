# services/__init__.py

# This is the __init__.py file for the "services" package.

# Import any modules or sub-packages that you want to make available
# when importing the "services" package.

# For example, if you have a module called "calculator" inside the "services"
# package, you can import it like this:
# from .calculator import *

# You can also define any package-level variables or functions here.

# Remember to add docstrings and comments to explain the purpose and usage
# of your code.

# Happy coding!
